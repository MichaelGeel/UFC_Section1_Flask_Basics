To install virtual environment:
    "py -m venv 'venv name'"
It'll then install, and to activate it:
    "env/Scripts/activate"
When it's activated, will then see an "(env)" at the beginning of each terminal line.
Will then install flask into the environment using:
    "pip install flask"
We'll then create our ain app file and name it:
    "app.py"
We'll set an environment variable in the command prompt:
    "set FLASK_APP = app.py"
This allows flask to know hwat file to look for when it wants to run.
It doesn't have to be app.py, but it is by conventional best practice and saves
on having to specify otherwise.
Now on to writing the code (see app.py for the code and notes.)
Note that an extra step was made necessary, VS Code had failed to detect the python
executable in the virtual environment, so in the root folder a ".vscode" folder had to be made,
within it, a settings.json file was created and contained the following json code:
    {
    "python.pythonPath": "$Section1_Flask_Basics/env/Scripts/python"
    }
This json code effectively tells vs code where in the projects root to find the python interpreter for
this particular project.
